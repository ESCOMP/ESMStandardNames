[release/v1] Bugfix for release/v1 branch

Tag this pull request with appropriate labels. If you do not have permission to add labels, list
the labels youâ€™d like to include in your PR description

Developers listed in the CODEOWNERS file will automatically be assigned to review your Pull Request.
If your contribution should be reviewed by anyone else, assign those reviewers manually from the

Changes to standard names and/or descriptions should be made in the standard_names.xml file. The
files Metadata-standard-names.md and Metadata-standard-names.yaml will need to be updated before
a pull request is merged; this can be done manually by the PR author using the script

Actions.
